                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Anomalous in classification, Serpens Mutabilis exhibits traits found in deep-sea serpentine species
                    but lacks definitive ties to any known biological lineage. Some speculate it could be an
                    evolutionary offshoot of gelatinous abyssal lifeforms, but its unique movement and structural
                    adaptability set it apart.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Located exclusively in the deepest regions of the Mariana Trench, Serpens Mutabilis thrives in
                    complete darkness, far beyond the reach of human civilization. It has been observed at depths
                    exceeding 10,000 meters, where pressures are extreme and sunlight does not penetrate. Its presence
                    suggests an adaptation to one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth, though how it sustains
                    itself remains unknown.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Serpens Mutabilis is an elongated, fluid-like entity with a shape reminiscent of both an eel and a
                    ribbon, yet its movement is more complex than either. Its body is segmented yet seamless, flexing
                    and twisting with unnatural smoothness.</p>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about SERPENS MUTABILIS?</span>
                Despite being one of the most elusive deep-sea discoveries, Serpens Mutabilis has sparked significant
                debate among researchers. Its method of propulsion remains unexplained, as does its ability to remain
                undetected in such an extreme environment.

                Some scientists believe it sustains itself through microscopic nutrient absorption, while others
                theorize it preys on similarly unknown abyssal organisms. Its lack of recorded interaction with any
                other species raises further questionsâ€”does it hunt in ways we cannot perceive, or does it exist in an
                entirely unique ecological niche?

                With only a handful of visual recordings, Serpens Mutabilis remains a mystery, an entity that challenges
                what we know about life in the deepest parts of the ocean. Further research is ongoing, though its
                evasive nature makes every new observation a rare and valuable event.
